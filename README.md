# Consumer-Shopping-Analysis
Introduction:
The main goal of this project was to see if I have the ability to contribute and help small clothing businesses in local communities with the use of statistical analysis. I was able to achieve this goal, by showcasing my ability to share educated and informed knowledge about purchasing trends within clothing. Of course, this specific project is not intended to help any ongoing business, as the data set is anonymous. However, this project showcases my ability to help businesses make educated decisions through data analyzation.  

Dataset Source:

Methods Used: 
- Descriptive analysis using python libraries such as statistics and numpy.
- Data Visualization using the python library matplotlib.

Insights and Conclusions: 
I found that the ages of customers varied immensely, and that all age groups were purchasing items at a number around the mean. It also did not matter whether they were male or female. With this information, I can confidently encourage companies to continue to advertise to all age groups. 
I also found that there was no correlation between age and the purchase amount. Therefore, I can recommend that there is no need for the company to focus on a specific age group when stocking items and advertising. 
I discovered that for all age groups, and for both men and women, clothing was always the most purchased item category. Therefore, I can recommend that stocking up on more clothing than other items by allocating their money differently can help them in the long run. 
I also found no differences in mens and womens shopping tendencies based on item categories, therefore there is no need to suggest focusing on different categories when advertising to the different genders. 
Lastly, I found that when using promo codes, customers generally do not increase purchase amounts by incentivizing purchases, so it may not be in the companies best interest to promote numerous discounts or promos if their goal is to have customers spend more.
